## 🗄️ MongoDB Collections

All data stored in `mes_erp_db` database:

1. **users** - User accounts with roles
2. **orders** - Production orders with auto-generated IDs
3. **reports** - Shopfloor production reports
4. **capacities** - Shopfloor capacity settings
5. **heartbeats** - Real-time shopfloor status
